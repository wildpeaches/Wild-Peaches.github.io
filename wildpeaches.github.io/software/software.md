# Software 

[Wild Peaches](https://wildpeaches.xyz/) aims to be as open and accessible to everyone as possible, so we use [software tools](https://wildpeaches.xyz/software/) that are free and open-source (FOSS) as much as possible, and at least free otherwise. Code written for an article is posted on [Github](https://gist.github.com/XerxesZorgon) to allow you to fully reproduce all of the results from the blog post. 

The code we write should be considered fully open and covered by the [GNU General Public License](https://www.fsf.org/). Beyond this license, you are free to use and modify the code however you like. At the bottom of this page is a link to the full text of the **LICENSE**. 

At the end of each article we list any code and software used (with links) to make it easy to begin experimenting. We encourage you to try out any software tools, and to download any of the code written for Wild Peaches. The best way to understand both the science and the art of coding is to try it yourself.
